# Java-Mortgage-Calculator


## Description

The Java Mortgage Calculator is a simple application that allows the user  to calculate their mortgage based off of the data they put in. The mortgage is calculated based off of the principle or the loan the user wants, the  annual interest rate of the loan, and the period in years the loan will be paid off.  The mortgage is then calculated in the monthly payments which will be paid  and then displays it as a currency.
